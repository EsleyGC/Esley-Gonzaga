                    <p>
                        Greetings! I'm Esley Gonzaga, a passionate game developer fueled by a love for crafting
                        immersive digital experiences.
                        My journey in game development began in 2013, delving into the creation of engaging fighting
                        games.
                        Since 2019, I've transitioned to utilizing the Unity and Unreal engine for professional game
                        development,
                        progressing from a hobbyist to a committed gameplay programmer.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        In the realm of game development, my focus centers on mastering the intricacies of the 3Cs –
                        Character, Controls, and Camera.
                        From fine-tuning movement and animation systems to orchestrating complex combat mechanics,
                        I find fulfillment in the challenge of crafting gameplay that captivates and entertains.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        My expertise extends beyond programming; My proficiency in both animation and game design not
                        only allows me to seamlessly collaborate
                        within a multidisciplinary team but also empowers me to translate creative visions into
                        enjoyable gameplay mechanics, ensuring a harmonious
                        fusion of technical precision and player engagement.

                            These tools empowered the game design team, which could, for example, utilize a data-driven
                            combat system that allowed them to work quickly and closely with the animation team.

                        <h3>Dicey Krime: Traveler of Time</h3>
                        <p>
                            As part of the development of Dicey Krime, a cartoon-style Beat 'em up by an Italian studio,
                            I contributed significantly by refining combat systems, upgrading AI, and working closely
                            with animators.
                            The goal was to achieve a visually engaging and entertaining game, staying true to the
                            original designers' intent.
